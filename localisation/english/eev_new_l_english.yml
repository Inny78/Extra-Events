 eev_houston.2.name: "Rescuing the science ship"
 eev_houston.2.desc: "Our constructor was working hard to repair §B[Root.GetFleetName]§! when the vortex erupted again, disabling the ships! Both crews are working frantically to repair their systems while their ships are getting closer to the planet. Our military ships have reinforced systems and better shields, they should be able to handle this, but if they don't, we will lose another ship."
 eev_houston.2a: "Have a military ship haul them to safety."
 eev_houston.2b: "We can't take the risk."

 eev_houston.3.name: "Left without repairs"
 eev_houston.3.desc: "The crew of §B[Root.GetFleetName]§! acknowledged the bad news and use their remaining time to gather as much data as they can. They were about to send a report when the anomaly erupts again. We would clearly have lost our construction ship too if we had sent one."

 eev_houston.4.name: "Military to the rescue"
 eev_houston.4.desc: "Our military vessels met with §B[eev_vortex_sci.GetFleetName]§! and our constructor and started to swiftly drag them away from the orbit of §Y[eev_vortex_pla.GetName]§!. The vortex exploded again but our guess was right: our fleet only suffered some minor malfunctions, and their redundant systems seamlessly kicked in. But a few minutes later, §G[eev_vortex_sci.GetLeaderName]§! warned that the anomaly's instability was now critical and urged the fleet to speed up, but before they could escape, the vortex ultimately collapsed, unleashing an colossal surge of energy — a final, blinding burst that was the last bit of information we recieved before losing all communications from [From.System.GetName]."
 eev_houston.4a: "This is bad..."

 eev_houston.5.name: "Military to the rescue"
 eev_houston.5.desc: "Our military vessels met with §B[eev_vortex_sci.GetFleetName]§! and started hauling it far from the orbit of §Y[eev_vortex_pla.GetName]§!. The vortex exploded again but our guess was right: our ships only suffered some minor malfunctions, and their redundant systems seamlessly kicked in. But a few minutes later, §G[eev_vortex_sci.GetLeaderName]§! warned that the anomaly's instability was now critical and urged the fleet to speed up, but before they could escape, the vortex ultimately collapsed, unleashing an colossal surge of energy — a final, blinding burst that was the last bit of information we recieved before losing all communications from [From.System.GetName]."

 eev_houston.6.name: "No rescue"
 eev_houston.6.desc: "The last transmission we received from §B[Root.GetFleetName]§! was the final gigantic destruction of the energy vortex as the ship started to enter the atmosphere of §Y[From.GetName]§!. There's no way they could have survived that."
 eev_houston.6a: "The universe is a dangerous place."

 eev_houston.7.name: "Rescue from out there"
 eev_houston.7.desc: "To the surprise of [Root.owner.Capital.GetName] control center, we received a transmission from our lost ships! They are all safe and excitedly reported an incredible story.\n\nAs they thought to be doomed, an alien ship of unknown design emerged from nowhere and shielded them from the full strength of the explosion. Then it used some energy beams to repair the damaged ships before disappearing at an incredible speed.\n\n§B[Root.GetFleetName]§!'s systems could only scan it for a few seconds, revealing that the strange ship wasn't using any known means of propulsion."
 eev_houston.7a: "Concerning..."

 eev_tower_city.1.name: "Giant tower"
 eev_tower_city.1.desc: "From the depths of the gas giant, where even our most robust shields would falter amidst the swirling mists of an unending magnetic storm, emerges a colossal cylinder crafted from metal and concrete. What's even more captivating is the city ruins perched atop this towering spire, with villages clinging precariously to its sides. To embark on an expedition into this enigmatic realm, we recognized the need for substantial resources. It was thus decided to establish a base camp within an open expanse of the city, serving as our launching point for exploration."

 # Archaeology site starts here
 eev_tower_city_dig: "The impossible city"
 eev_tower_city_dig_desc: "Our science team is currently hard at work establishing a base camp. Given the widespread debris and dilapidated structures throughout, advancing our operations will demand extensive drilling and consolidation efforts. Nevertheless, the intriguing mysteries concealed within this locale have fueled the team's enthusiasm, driving us to commence our endeavors."

 eev_tower_city_dig.1.name: "Exploring the city"
 eev_tower_city_dig.1.desc: "Our team is now ready to explore this strange place. The upper half of the tower is at the middle of the comfort zone where the pressure and temperature of the atmosphere makes it habitable. The city ruins sprawl across the majority of the cylinder's peak, undoubtedly harboring the most valuable data we seek. Few are inclined to venture downward and investigate the vertical villages clinging to the pillar's sides."

 eev_tower_city_dig.2.name: "Mysteries of the past"
 eev_tower_city_dig.2.desc: "Our initial discoveries have left us perplexed. The city's inhabitants were evidently confined to a pre-spatial technology stage, hindered by the absolute scarcity of resources of their impossible home. This raises even more questions. These findings give rise to a multitude of questions. The construction of the pillar couldn't have been their doing, so who were its architects, and by what means was it erected? And how did these primitives came to live here?"

 eev_tower_city_dig.3.name: "Breaking in"
 eev_tower_city_dig.3.desc: "The science team arrived in front of a grand edifice, still imposing despite its partial state of ruin. After breaking in, they uncovered the first remains of the humanoid inhabitants and stationed a few members to collect samples and conduct analyses. Progressing further, §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! entered what appeared to be a restricted zone. Scans indicate that the interior remains largely intact, but given the compromised ceilings and reinforced walls, gaining access will undoubtedly necessitate significant effort."

 eev_tower_city_dig.4.name: "Broken by war"
 eev_tower_city_dig.4.desc: "We finally gained access to the interior of the bunker and found a huge computer that is intricately linked to the entire cylinder. The initial dataset we acquired is enough to leave one's head spinning. It turns out this structure isn't merely a massive pillar but a colossal skyscraper. Its interior was abandoned eons ago, following a brutal civil war that shattered their society. Over time, they regressed into primitiveness as their once-advanced equipment fell into disrepair. The last tribes to roam the surface found themselves unable to comprehend their ancient technology. With the final synthesizers ceasing to function, their demise swiftly followed."
 eev_tower_city_dig.4a: "A tragic tale."
 eev_tower_city_dig.4t: "This ancient building is a feat of engineering that will keep our scientists busy for centuries."

 eev_scanned.1.name: "Alien probe"
 eev_scanned.1.desc: "A probe of unknown origin suddenly appeared from nowhere and started to scan our ship. §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! pointed the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§!'s scanners on the probe but it disappeared at an impossible speed. The analysis of the mere seconds of data we could gather shows that it uses the same technology than the unknown ship that saved our fleets from the collapsing energy vortex."
 eev_scanned.1a: "Their technology is far beyond anything we know."
 eev_scanned.1b: "Their technology is an unacceptable threat."

# Ancient Echoes
 eev_ancient_echoes_category: "Ancient Echoes"
 eev_ancient_echoes_category_desc: "Our ship's instruments have detected an influx of tachyons emanating from a dimensional rift above §Y[From.GetName]§!. §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! has decided to launch a probe from a safe distance to gather as much data as possible."
 eev_ancient_echoes.1.name: "Battle from the past"
 eev_ancient_echoes.1.desc: "Our probe captured a harrowing spectacle beyond the rift: two colossal alien fleets locked in a relentless and brutal conflict, using weapons of unparalleled strength. Brilliant eruptions of energy bathed the entire system in blinding radiance as they dispersed against seemingly impenetrable shields. Then, a concentrated barrage breached the defenses of a capital ship, striking its reactor. The ensuing explosion momentarily blinded our probe, and when our instruments regained clarity, the rift had vanished. Subsequent analysis of star positions and tachyon energy signatures pinpointed the battle's occurrence as over a million years in the past."

# Mysterious Cache
 eev_mysterious_cache_category: "Mysterious Cache"
 eev_mysterious_cache_category_desc: "Our sensors have spotted a faint signal emanating from §Y[From.GetName]§!. Moving closer, the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§! discovered that it's emanating from an old building that stands alone on this desolate world."
 eev_mysterious_cache.1.name: "A gift from the past"
 eev_mysterious_cache.1.desc: "Gaining entry into the building proved a formidable challenge due to its thick, impregnable walls and a conspicuous absence of any visible entrance.  These robust fortifications concealed a small room that harbored a central altar adorned with an intricately designed box. Scans indicate the building and the box are eleven thousands years old. However, the most perplexing revelation was the presence of inscriptions on the altar, inscribed in our modern language! Even more disconcerting is that they precisely name §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§!, claiming the box as a gift for [Root.Leader.GetHerHim]. The box itself, crafted from an unknown alloy, exhibited an astonishing heft — a treasure trove of untold potential for our scientists to dissect and analyze. But who made this remarkable gift, and  how did they possess such prescient knowledge of our arrival?"

# Crashed colony ship
 eev_crashcol_category: "Metallic debris"
 eev_crashcol_category_desc: "Our ship's sensors have detected some metallic debris on the surface of §Y[From.GetName]§!. The team is preparing an expedition to investigate."
 eev_crashcol.1.name: "Crashed colony ship"
 eev_crashcol.1.desc: "The scientific expedition discovered the remains of an ancient colony ship of unknown origin Dwarfing our own designs in size, this colossal vessel met its catastrophic end on a plateau several millennia ago, claiming the lives of all who were aboard. Regrettably, the onboard computers lay in complete ruin, rendering any attempt to ascertain its point of origin futile. Nonetheless, the hulking wreckage boasts a wealth of valuable alloys. In anticipation of a future recovery mission, our team placed a beacon to mark its location."
 eev_crashcol.2.name: "Recovery completed"
 eev_crashcol.2.desc: "A recovery expedition just came back from the crashed colony ship with its hold full of alloys. This will certainly prove useful for our empire."

 supernova.5.desc: "Our science ship has observed the most violent and massive plasma vortexes ever spotted in a star. This phenomenon is generating extreme waves of radiations but §B[Root.GetFleetName]§!'s shields support their assault. §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! announced that this star will probably explode in a supernova before the next millennia. The crew has collected some exciting data that will have an important impact in physics research."

 unstable_gas.2.name: "Plasmoid gathering"
 unstable_gas.2.desc: "§G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! reports a remarkable discovery: the detection of a substantial herd of plasmoid beings within the gas giant's atmosphere. These extraordinary entities are voraciously consuming the planet's hydrogen, setting it ablaze with their staggering temperatures. At their current pace, it appears they will spend the next few centuries feasting upon §Y[From.GetName]§!'s resources before eventually departing in search of a new pasture."

 boom_asteroid.2.name: "Malfunction"
 boom_asteroid.2.desc: "As the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§!'s crew conducted a closer examination of the metallic structure, they unwittingly triggered an ear-splitting alarm that pierced the air. The countdown began at 30 seconds, alarming the crew as they spotted massive nuclear devices. Panic set in as they grappled with the realization that they were facing a dire situation. Thinking quickly, the crew attempted to disarm the devices, but they were inscribed with an incomprehensible alien script. Moments later, the countdown reached its conclusion... and nothing occurred. Gripped by the fear that it could activate at any instant, the crew hastily retreated to the safety of the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§!"
 boom_asteroid.1.a: "At least everyone is safe."

 eev_new_queen.1.tt: "Your Mind will focus on the Network to find the source of the disturbances."

 eev_new_queen.2.name: "Source discovered"
 eev_new_queen.2.desc: "The disturbances in our network were faint at start, but they kept becoming stronger. You finally found the cause: somehow, one of your drone has mutated, its mind becoming independent and expanding its will. The impossible happened: a new Mind is claiming your very Network as its own."
 eev_new_queen.2.a: "This is intolerable. Kill it by any means necessary."
 eev_new_queen.2.b: "Isolate the mutant drone and study it."
 eev_new_queen.2.c: "Deviation is food."

 eev_new_queen.3.name: "Clear Network"
 eev_new_queen.3.desc: "Stopping the mutant drone was not an easy task, as some of your drones switched sides as they approached it. Focusing your Mind like you never did, though, you managed to overcome its grip and regain control of them. It's being disposed as you wanted, but something alerted your drones as they found some strange vials containing a swirling liquid. You know everything that is built in your hive, and this is not one of them."
