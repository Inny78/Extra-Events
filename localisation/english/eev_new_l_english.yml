# Energy Vortex, alias « Houston, we have a problem »
 eev_houston.1.name: "[Root.owner.Capital.GetName], we have a problem."
 eev_houston.1.desc: "Unfortunately, the scan has had dire consequences. It agitated the vortex, unleashing a potent energy surge that disrupted the ship's engines. As a result, the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§! now drifts inexorably toward the planet's gravitational pull. Without repairs, it will crash into §Y[From.GetName]§!."
 eev_houston.1a: "Send a construction ship at once!"
 eev_houston.2.name: "Rescuing the science ship"
 eev_houston.2.desc: "Our constructor was working hard to repair §B[Root.GetFleetName]§! when the vortex erupted again, disabling the ships! Both crews are working frantically to repair their systems while their ships are getting closer to the planet. Our military ships have reinforced systems and better shields, they should be able to handle this, but if they don't, we will lose another ship."
 eev_houston.2a: "Have a military ship haul them to safety."
 eev_houston.2b: "We can't take the risk."
 eev_houston.3.name: "Left without repairs"
 eev_houston.3.desc: "The crew of §B[Root.GetFleetName]§! acknowledged the bad news and use their remaining time to gather as much data as they can. They were about to send a report when the anomaly erupts again. We would clearly have lost our construction ship too if we had sent one to help."
 eev_houston.4.name: "Military to the rescue"
 eev_houston.4.desc: "Our military vessels met with §B[eev_vortex_sci.GetFleetName]§! and our constructor and started to swiftly drag them away from the orbit of §Y[eev_vortex_pla.GetName]§!. The vortex exploded again but our guess was right: our fleet only suffered some minor malfunctions, and their redundant systems seamlessly kicked in. But a few minutes later, §G[eev_vortex_sci.GetLeaderName]§! warned that the anomaly's instability was now critical and urged the fleet to speed up, but before they could escape, the vortex ultimately collapsed, unleashing an colossal surge of energy - a final, blinding burst that was the last bit of information we recieved before losing all communications from [From.System.GetName]."
 eev_houston.4a: "This is bad..."
 eev_houston.5.name: "Military to the rescue"
 eev_houston.5.desc: "Our military vessels met with §B[eev_vortex_sci.GetFleetName]§! and started hauling it far from the orbit of §Y[eev_vortex_pla.GetName]§!.

But a few minutes later, §G[eev_vortex_sci.GetLeaderName]§! warned that the anomaly's instability was now critical and urged the fleet to speed up, but before they could escape, the vortex ultimately collapsed, unleashing an colossal surge of energy - a final, blinding burst that was the last bit of information we recieved before losing all communications from [From.System.GetName]."
 eev_houston.6.name: "No rescue"
 eev_houston.6.desc: "The last transmission we received from §B[Root.GetFleetName]§! was the final gigantic destruction of the energy vortex as the ship started to enter the atmosphere of §Y[From.GetName]§!. There's no way they could have survived that."
 eev_houston.6a: "The universe is a dangerous place."
 eev_houston.7.name: "Rescue from out there"
 eev_houston.7.desc: "To the surprise of [Root.owner.Capital.GetName] control center, we received a transmission from our lost ships! They are all safe and excitedly reported an incredible story.\n\nAs they thought to be doomed, an alien ship of unknown design emerged from nowhere and shielded them from the full strength of the explosion. Then it used some energy beams to repair the damaged ships before disappearing at an incredible speed.\n\n§B[Root.GetFleetName]§!'s systems could only scan it for a few seconds, revealing that the strange ship wasn't using any known means of propulsion."

 eev_scanned.1.name: "Alien probe"
 eev_scanned.1.desc: "A probe of unknown origin suddenly appeared from nowhere and started to scan our ship. §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! pointed the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§!'s scanners on the probe but it disappeared at an impossible speed. The analysis of the mere seconds of data we could gather shows that it uses the same technology than the §SAncient Beholders§!' ship that saved our fleets from the collapsing energy vortex."
 eev_scanned.1a: "Their technology is far beyond anything we know."
 eev_scanned.1b: "Their technology is an unacceptable threat."

# Ancient Echoes
 eev_ancient_echoes.1.name: "Battle from the past"
 eev_ancient_echoes.1.desc: "Our probe captured a harrowing spectacle beyond the rift: two colossal alien fleets locked in a relentless and brutal conflict, using weapons of unparalleled strength. Brilliant eruptions of energy bathed the entire system in blinding radiance as they dispersed against seemingly impenetrable shields. Then, a concentrated barrage breached the defenses of a capital ship, striking its reactor. The ensuing explosion momentarily blinded our probe, and when our instruments regained clarity, the rift had vanished. Subsequent analysis of star positions and tachyon energy signatures pinpointed the battle's occurrence as over a million years in the past."

# Mysterious Cache
 eev_mysterious_cache.1.name: "A gift from the past"
 eev_mysterious_cache.1.desc: "Gaining entry into the building proved a formidable challenge due to its thick, impregnable walls and a conspicuous absence of any visible entrance. These robust fortifications concealed a small room that harbored a central altar adorned with an intricately designed box. Scans indicate the building and the box are eleven thousands years old. However, the most perplexing revelation was the presence of inscriptions on the altar, inscribed in our modern language! Even more disconcerting is that they precisely name §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§!, claiming the box as a gift for [Root.Leader.GetHerHim]. The box itself, crafted from an unknown alloy, exhibited an astonishing heft - a treasure trove of untold potential for our scientists to dissect and analyze. But who made this remarkable gift, and  how did they possess such prescient knowledge of our arrival?"

# Anomalies - alternate endings
 supernova.1.name: "Unusual fluctuations"
 supernova.1.desc: "§B[Root.GetFleetName]§!'s instruments has detected internal fluctuations of plasma on a massive scale. The crew is having a hard time getting detailed readings due to the gravimetric interference emitted by these fluctuations and they will have to get closer to the star to know what's going on."
 supernova.2.name: "Massive plasma vortexes"
 supernova.2.desc: "Our science ship has observed the most violent and massive plasma vortexes ever spotted in a star. This phenomenon is generating extreme waves of radiations but §B[Root.GetFleetName]§!'s shields support their assault. §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! announced that this star will probably explode in a supernova before the next millennia. The crew has collected some exciting data that will have an important impact in physics research."

 unstable_gas.1.name: "Plasmoid gathering"
 unstable_gas.1.desc: "§G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! reports a remarkable discovery: the detection of a substantial herd of plasmoid beings within the gas giant's atmosphere. These extraordinary entities are voraciously consuming the planet's hydrogen, setting it ablaze with their staggering temperatures. At their current pace, it appears they will spend the next few centuries feasting upon §Y[From.GetName]§!'s resources before eventually departing in search of a new pasture."

 boom_asteroid.2.name: "Malfunction"
 boom_asteroid.2.desc: "As the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§!'s crew conducted a closer examination of the metallic structure, they unwittingly triggered an ear-splitting alarm that pierced the air. The countdown began at 30 seconds, alarming the crew as they spotted massive nuclear devices. Panic set in as they grappled with the realization that they were facing a dire situation. Thinking quickly, the crew attempted to disarm the devices, but they were inscribed with an incomprehensible alien script. Moments later, the countdown reached its conclusion... and nothing occurred. Gripped by the fear that it could activate at any instant, the crew hastily retreated to the safety of the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§!"

 murder_event.10.b: "I knew they were dangerous! Keep analyzing the data, we must find their weakness."

 eev_new_queen.1.name: "A perturbation in the network"
 eev_new_queen.1.desc: "Within the vast interconnected networks binding your hive mind to its drones, a growing unease has taken root. A disquieting sensation pervades your consciousness, yet the source of this disquiet eludes your grasp. With each passing moment, the feeling intensifies, gnawing at the very core of your being."
 eev_new_queen.1.a: "Distraction can't be allowed"
