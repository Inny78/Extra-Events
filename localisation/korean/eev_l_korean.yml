 ancient_flag.1.name: "Ancient Civilizations Flag"
 ancient_flag.1.desc: "It appears that this object was placed here by an ancient civilization approximately 3,000 years ago. In their culture, marking celestial objects with flags may have been a way to lay claim to regions in space. Since there is little to no wind on §Y[From.GetName]§!, the flag remains remarkably intact, albeit with its colors faded by the relentless, unfiltered sun. The fate of this civilization, however, remains a mystery."
 space_grave.1.name: "Space Grave"
 space_grave.1.desc: "The crew not only discovered mummified bodies in orbit around §Y[From.GetName]§! but also encountered countless skeletal remains on the planet's surface. This mass extinction event appears to be the outcome of a cataclysmic incident that transpired several millennia ago. Some individuals seemingly attempted to escape the surface's calamity, but their ships met a tragic fate, exploding during their attempted departure from their homeworld. The exact nature of this catastrophic event remains shrouded in mystery, as numerous theories, such as asteroid impacts or volcanic eruptions, have been ruled out."
 mineral_monolith.1.name: "A Mineral Monolith"
 mineral_monolith.1.desc: "§G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! and the crew of the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§! have completed their study of the rock, and the findings are indeed intriguing. According to §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§!, this massive stone was likely venerated as a deity or symbol of peace by a primitive civilization approximately 10,000 years ago. The rock's surface is adorned with markings inscribed in an ancient language. However, it's evident that the rock is slowly deteriorating. §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! proposes three options: preserving it in one of our geology museums for public display, extracting valuable minerals from it, or offering it for sale to collectors."
 mineral_monolith.1.a: "£minerals£ Scrap it."
 mineral_monolith.1.b: "£unity£ Keep it."
 mineral_monolith.1.c: "£energy£ Sell it."
 mineral_monolith.1.d: "Don't touch it!"
 last_words.1.name: "An Adventurers Last Words"
 last_words.1.desc: "The crew of the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§! has located the device responsible for emitting the previously detected pings. Upon examination, it appears to contain the final communication of an alien adventurer. Our scientists have successfully translated the alien language, revealing the following message: \n\n§SCommander! Commander!? Can you hear me, Commander? I've found it! After all these years, I've actually found it! I just need to take its... wait. It's... moving? It's still alive! ... It's seen me! In case I don't make it, my coordinates are AGH-§! \n\nThat's all we have. We may never know who or what she found as this commander seems to have bombed the planet. Nothing alive is on this planet but us."
 last_words.1.a: "A moment of silence."
 mineral_core.1.name: "A Mineral Core"
 mineral_core.1.desc: "§G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! is reporting that the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§! crew has pinpointed the reason why the planet has more mass than previously recorded. \n\nIt turns out that the core of the planet has started to stop spinning.this planet's core has experienced a rapid decline in the speed of its rotationary momentum. This will allow us to safely mine deeper into the planet's core, providing an extensive amount of resources for our empire."
 mineral_core.1.a: "£minerals£ A glorious day for us!"
 bad_fate.1.name: "A Devastating Fate"
 bad_fate.1.desc: "Upon even closer examination, it appears that §Y[From.GetName]§! is the result of a collision between two planets, which the crew of the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§! has dubbed §SFate§! and §SDestiny§!.  Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this discovery is the revelation that one of these planets once hosted a thriving civilization - a truly remarkable find."
 bad_fate.1.b: "Rest in peace."
 rocky_egg.1.name: "The Giant Rocky Egg"
 rocky_egg.1.desc: "§G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! and the crew of the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§! are telling us that this planet is actually an egg million of years old! \n\nThe egg has collected an enormous mass over the past few million years from other celestial bodies! \n\n§G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! tell us to not worry, though, as the egg won't hatch for another couple million years. \n\nIt is truly a miracle that something like this could exist. The creature seems to be extremely rare, and this egg could probably be the only thing left of their race. Our scientists are amazed by this discovery."
 gassy_planet.1.name: "A Gassy Planet"
 gassy_planet.1.desc: "While conducting an extensive scan of the planet, the crew of the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§! has discerned that the previous inhabitants of this world were compelled to abandon it due to its impending demise. §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! posits that the planet's deterioration was a consequence of a colossal volcano ejecting toxic gases into the atmosphere. The current whereabouts of the former inhabitants remain shrouded in mystery."
 doomed_civ.1.name: "Escape Trajectory"
 doomed_civ.1.desc: "While scanning the remnants of the crashed space shuttle, the crew of the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§! stumbled upon something unsettling. The ship appears to be more of an escape pod, following an escape trajectory from their home planet. According to the salvageable data found in the ship's database, their home planet was facing a dire catastrophe. The disaster that befell their homeworld must have been incredibly devastating, as the escape pod missed its intended target."
 lost_treasure.1.name: "A Lost Treasure"
 lost_treasure.1.desc: "The crew of the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§! has successfully traced the origin of the signal, revealing an automated freighter brimming with invaluable and rare treasures. §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! postulates that the freighter fell prey to the planet's gravitational pull while on its designated course. It appears to have been governed by a rudimentary AI system that malfunctioned, which explains why it got caught up so easily."
 lost_treasure.1.a: "Sell it. We can always use more £energy£ Energy."

 #1.3
 crushed.1.name: "Crushed Civilization"
 crushed.1.desc: "While exploring the planet, the crew of the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§! encountered a remarkably small, yet somewhat intelligent civilization. Our ship landed directly on them, inadvertently killing 90% of the population, leaving those who survived understandably displeased. The survivors expressed their discontent by pelting the scientists' feet with small rocks. Nevertheless, the allure of that valuable, shiny object was too enticing to resist!"
 perfect_planet.1.name: "A Perfect Planet"
 perfect_planet.1.desc: "This planet is truly remarkable! Golden rivers and mountains of minerals! There is so much we can obtain from this planet."
 ancient_fossils.1.name: "Ancient Civilization Fossils"
 ancient_fossils.1.desc: "The crew of the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§! was right. Millions of years ago a civilization lived on this planet, and it appears to have been very advanced. \n\n§G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! does not know what killed off this civilization. Perhaps it was an asteroid or super volcano. \n\nWhatever happened does not matter, what does matter is that there is much to learn from their remains!"
 space_knights.1.name: "Space Knights"
 space_knights.1.desc: "A medieval species once roamed this planet, but they died in a spectacular way! Two factions ruled the planet, warring each other for territory in an endless battle that §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! theorizes began 5000 years before they eventually met their demise. The last battle these two warring factions were a part of destroyed their planet and it never recovered. Even more so they believe the cause of this war was the belief in a god."

 #1.4
 asteroid_attack.1.name: "An Asteroid Attack"
 asteroid_attack.1.desc: "Those caves were indeed made by something, but not a person... While searching the cave system of the asteroid, the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§! crew found something which they described as horrifically terrifying and soon after dropped communications with us. Most of the scientists made it out alive, but the others will be missed."
 asteroid_attack.1.a: "Such a shame."
 ayy.1.name: "Local Aliens"
 ayy.1.desc: "§G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! has found the lights, and those lights were connected to houses which had aliens inside of them with... less than average intelligence. \n\nThey claim that their empire is great and wishes to colonize everything in the galaxy. Habitable or not. \n\n§G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! says that these aliens are actually terrified of us and claims that they just want us gone and are willing to pay."

 ayy.1.b: "Leave them in peace."
 ayy.1.c: "Recruit them for our armies."
 ayy.1.d: "Blow these xenos up!"
 storms.1.name: "The Infinite Storm"
 storms.1.desc: "The planet's storms seems to have begun millions of years ago when the planet was still very young. Lead scientist §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! theorizes that there will be no end to this storm until something drastic changes this planet. §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! says we do have the power to stop the storm and suggests we do so if we ever plan to colonize the planet."
 storms.1.a: "It's too expensive."
 storms.1.b: "Stop the storm."

 #1.5
 ai_factory.1.name: "AI Factory"
 ai_factory.1.desc: "As it turns out, the subterranean structure is not merely a building but a sprawling factory, meticulously engineered for the mass production of AI robots. Its creators, an unidentified race, fashioned it with the singular goal of churning out these artificial entities. Astonishingly, the factory continues to operate, relentlessly consuming the planet's resources. The robots within are presently dormant, but §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! cautions that allowing the factory to complete its production could pose a significant threat."
 ai_factory.1.a: "Let the factory be."
 ai_factory.1.b: "Destroy the factory!"
 ai_factory.1.c: "Let the factory be and learn from it."
 space_nomads.1.name: "Space Nomads"
 space_nomads.1.desc: "As the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§! approached the the cargo ship we were greeted by some very nice nomads who call themselves §SThe Wanderers§!. \n\nThey were nice enough to tell us of their journeys across the galaxy, their encounters with alien races, and their poor financial situation over some spicy food and a drink they called §SGlabnak§!. After the festivities we parted ways but not before they gave us their recipe for §SGlabnak§!. \n\n§G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! suggests we help their financial situation with a donation of 200 energy."
 space_nomads.1.a: "We lack the funds..."
 space_nomads.1.b: "Of course!"
 space_nomads.1.c: "Send them away."
 space_nomads.1.d: "Send these xeno-scum away already!"
 space_nomads.1.e: "We lack the funds, but we will let our nation know of your kind people!"
 space_nomads.1.f: "Recruit these xenos and lead them to victory."

 water_monster.1.b: "The young fool..."

 #1.6
 abandoned_base.1.name: "Deserters"
 abandoned_base.1.desc: "As we approached this metallic object it became clear to the scientists that it was a military compound of sorts built into the side of a mountain. \n\nWhen our scientists went in for a closer look they were greeted with guns, but after the scientists assured them that they came in peace all hostilities were neutralized as they greeted themselves as §SThe Free Folk§! and as a way to say sorry they decided to treat our scientists to dinner. \n\n§G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! has sent us messages about these §SFree Folk§! being deserters of their former empire and that they have riches beyond what scavengers like these should have."

Who's to say they'll remain loyal to us?"
 abandoned_base.2.a: "Welcome to our empire, Free Folk!"
 abandoned_base.2.b: "Never mind then."
 abandoned_base.2.tooltip: "Continues the Story"
 infinium.1.name: "Infinium Ore"
 infinium.1.desc: "This mineral our scientists found is truly magnificent! Under intense heat it can be molded into anything, and when cooled back down its nearly indestructible! \n\nOur scientists have started calling it §SInfinium§! for its nearly infinite uses. \n\n§G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! suggest keeping this Infinium for further research and use, but says we could also sell it if we really need the money."
 infinium.1.a: "£minerals£ Keep it."
 infinium.1.b: "£energy£ Sell it."
 error.1.name: "Artificial Life"
 error.1.desc: "The planet does in fact have artificial lifeforms patrolling the planet, but for what reason we do not know. \n\nAs we attempted to contact one of these lifeforms they would just repeat: §RERROR-703, PATH - NOT - FOUND§!. And when our scientists were spotted they would repeat: §RERROR-001, LIFEFORM - DETECTED§!. \n\n§G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! suggests kidnapping one of these lifeforms to find their purpose, or we could simply scrap them all, or maybe sell them?"

 mutiny.1.name: "Mutiny!"
 mutiny.1.desc: "Our scientists have found a large quantity of minerals inside the cargo ship! Unfortunately some of our scientists decided they would rather keep them for their own personal benefit and formed a mutiny against §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! and [Root.Leader.GetHerHis] most loyal scientists. \n\nHow should we proceed?"
 mutiny.1.a: "Attempt to negotiate with them."

 mutiny.3.name: "Situation Neutralized"
 mutiny.3.desc: "We were just informed of the events that have taken place after we let the scientists sort it out by themselves. It appears our lead scientist and those most loyal to [Root.Leader.GetHerHim] were killed. However those who lead the mutiny have agreed to continue to work for us as long as they can take the minerals they wanted."
 mutiny.2.tooltip: "The science ship will be blown up."
 artificial_sun.1.name: "An Artificial Sun"
 artificial_sun.1.desc: "The §Y[From.GetName]§! sun is outstanding! Not because its shape was off, but because it was built by some alien species long ago! \n\nFrom what §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! has gathered the reasoning behind building this sun was that their old one was about to die in the near future. However it didn't work out for them as they have been extinct for thousands of years now."
 blackhole_life.1.name: "A Black Hole Ecosystem"
 blackhole_life.1.desc: "There are indeed lifeforms inside the black hole! \n\nThese lifeforms are somehow able to to pass through the event horizon at will without going faster than the speed of light. In fact, they are quite slow. \n\nThey seem to live inside the black hole and only come out to feed on the spacedust nearby. We're unable to see what lies beyond the event horizon as our technology isn't that advanced."
 blackhole_life.1.a: "Outstanding!"
 frozen_civilization.1.name: "A Frozen Civilization"
 frozen_civilization.1.desc: "After further research the crew of the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§! has discovered that not only are the buildings encased in ice, but frozen sentient organisms too. \n\nBiometric scans reveal that they are in fact still alive. Their technology seems to be far more primitive than our own. \n\nIt appears that a sudden change in orbit occurred, causing the planet to almost instantly freeze. Multiple theories have been suggested by the science community, yet none have any proof. Regardless, Science Officer §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! has begun artificially unfreezing the planet. \n\nWhile the planet was being thawed a facility was constructed to study the aliens going back to their pre-frozen lives. It took a few days before their bodies completely thawed. Sadly, only a few hundred of them survived the process. \n\nSome of our scientists were caught off guard by the creatures once they awakened. Luckily, security measures were taken to prevent some of them from going on a rampage. They were put on anesthetics and a small transport ship carried them to what to us seems like an important landmark. \n\nOnce they fully awakened from the anesthetics they seemed very confused. A few of them started to attack, but one of them rose up and convinced the rest to calm down. The crew was fascinated by the primitive creatures."

 star_stuff.4.a: "Interesting."

 star_stuff.5.name: "A G-Type Star"
 star_stuff.5.desc: "This yellow dwarf is known as a G-Type star. These stars fuse hydrogen for roughly 10 billion years before they expand and become red giants. \n\nAlthough the G-Type star's lifespan is shorter than a K-Type star, worlds inside the habitable zone of a G-Type star enjoy optimal conditions for the development of life."
 star_stuff.5.a: "Amazing."

 star_stuff.6.name: "A K-Type Star"

 star_stuff.7.a: "Incredible."

 star_stuff.8.name: "A Neutron Star"
 star_stuff.8.desc: "This incredibly dense star is known as a Neutron Star and is often created when a massive star suffers a rapid collapse and explodes in a supernova. \n\nAlthough their diameter is as a little as ten kilometers their mass is even greater than an average G-Type star!"
 star_stuff.8.a: "Incredible!"

 star_stuff.9.name: "A Black Hole"
 star_stuff.9.desc: "This is known as a Black Hole and is formed as a result of the collapse of a very massive star at the end of its life cycle. \n\nBlack Holes have an extremely strong gravitational field that prevent anything - even light - from escaping once it enters the event horizon. \n\nThe crew had to be very careful when studying this monster of a star."
 star_stuff.9.a: "Amazing!"

 star_stuff.10.name: "A Pulsar"
 star_stuff.10.desc: "Pulsars are highly magnetized neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation. \n\nA Pulsar is only visible when the radiation beam is pointing directly at the observer which results in a very precise interval of pulses that can sometimes be so exact that it can be used to measure the passage of time with extreme accuracy."
 star_stuff.10.a: "Incredible!"

 star_stuff.11.name: "Studies Complete"
 star_stuff.11.desc: "After all these years we have completed our studies of all known star types in the universe.

We tried to ID this man but it was as if he was a ghost, and he ignored every question except for one. We asked 'What is your name?', his only response was 'I am Death'.  \n\nAs we expected we found a note in the CEOs pockets reading: 'Not even money could save her, and trust me she offered plenty.

 murder_event.8.a: "At least something came from this."
