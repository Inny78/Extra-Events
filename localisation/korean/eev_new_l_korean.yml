# Unexpected tower, alias Farewell Horizontal
 eev_tower_city.1.name: "Giant tower"
 eev_tower_city.1.desc: "From the depths of the gas giant, where even our most robust shields would falter amidst the swirling mists of an unending magnetic storm, emerges a colossal cylinder crafted from metal and concrete. What's even more captivating is the city ruins perched atop this towering spire, with villages clinging precariously to its sides. To embark on an expedition into this enigmatic realm, we recognized the need for substantial resources. It was thus decided to establish a base camp within an open expanse of the city, serving as our launching point for exploration."
 # Archaeology site starts here
 eev_tower_city_dig: "The impossible city"
 eev_tower_city_dig_desc: "Our science team is currently hard at work establishing a base camp. Given the widespread debris and dilapidated structures throughout, advancing our operations will demand extensive drilling and consolidation efforts. Nevertheless, the intriguing mysteries concealed within this locale have fueled the team's enthusiasm, driving us to commence our endeavors."
 eev_tower_city_dig.1.name: "Exploring the city"
 eev_tower_city_dig.1.desc: "Our team is now ready to explore this strange place. The upper half of the tower is at the middle of the comfort zone where the pressure and temperature of the atmosphere makes it habitable. The city ruins sprawl across the majority of the cylinder's peak, undoubtedly harboring the most valuable data we seek. Few are inclined to venture downward and investigate the vertical villages clinging to the pillar's sides."
 eev_tower_city_dig.2.name: "Mysteries of the past"
 eev_tower_city_dig.2.desc: "Our initial discoveries have left us perplexed. The city's inhabitants were evidently confined to a pre-spatial technology stage, hindered by the absolute scarcity of resources of their impossible home. This raises even more questions. These findings give rise to a multitude of questions. The construction of the pillar couldn't have been their doing, so who were its architects, and by what means was it erected? And how did these primitives came to live here?"
 eev_tower_city_dig.3.name: "Breaking in"
 eev_tower_city_dig.3.desc: "The science team arrived in front of a grand edifice, still imposing despite its partial state of ruin. After breaking in, they uncovered the first remains of the humanoid inhabitants and stationed a few members to collect samples and conduct analyses. Progressing further, §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! entered what appeared to be a restricted zone. Scans indicate that the interior remains largely intact, but given the compromised ceilings and reinforced walls, gaining access will undoubtedly necessitate significant effort."
 eev_tower_city_dig.4.name: "Broken by war"
 eev_tower_city_dig.4.desc: "We finally gained access to the interior of the bunker and found a huge computer that is intricately linked to the entire cylinder. The initial dataset we acquired is enough to leave one's head spinning. It turns out this structure isn't merely a massive pillar but a colossal skyscraper. Its interior was abandoned eons ago, following a brutal civil war that shattered their society. Over time, they regressed into primitiveness as their once-advanced equipment fell into disrepair. The last tribes to roam the surface found themselves unable to comprehend their ancient technology. With the final synthesizers ceasing to function, their demise swiftly followed."
 eev_tower_city_dig.4a: "A tragic tale."
 eev_tower_city_dig.4t: "This ancient building is a feat of engineering that will keep our scientists busy for centuries."

 # Scanned
 eev_scanned.1.name: "Alien probe"
 eev_scanned.1.desc: "A probe of unknown origin suddenly appeared from nowhere and started to scan our ship. §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! pointed the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§!'s scanners on the probe but it disappeared at an impossible speed. The analysis of the mere seconds of data we could gather shows that it uses the same technology than the unknown ship that saved our fleets from the collapsing energy vortex."
 eev_scanned.1a: "Their technology is far beyond anything we know."
 eev_scanned.1b: "Their technology is an unacceptable threat."

# Ancient Echoes
 eev_ancient_echoes.1.name: "Battle from the past"
 eev_ancient_echoes.1.desc: "Our probe captured a harrowing spectacle beyond the rift: two colossal alien fleets locked in a relentless and brutal conflict, using weapons of unparalleled strength. Brilliant eruptions of energy bathed the entire system in blinding radiance as they dispersed against seemingly impenetrable shields. Then, a concentrated barrage breached the defenses of a capital ship, striking its reactor. The ensuing explosion momentarily blinded our probe, and when our instruments regained clarity, the rift had vanished. Subsequent analysis of star positions and tachyon energy signatures pinpointed the battle's occurrence as over a million years in the past."

# Mysterious Cache
 eev_mysterious_cache.1.name: "A gift from the past"
 eev_mysterious_cache.1.desc: "Gaining entry into the building proved a formidable challenge due to its thick, impregnable walls and a conspicuous absence of any visible entrance. These robust fortifications concealed a small room that harbored a central altar adorned with an intricately designed box. Scans indicate the building and the box are eleven thousands years old. However, the most perplexing revelation was the presence of inscriptions on the altar, inscribed in our modern language! Even more disconcerting is that they precisely name §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§!, claiming the box as a gift for [Root.Leader.GetHerHim]. The box itself, crafted from an unknown alloy, exhibited an astonishing heft - a treasure trove of untold potential for our scientists to dissect and analyze. But who made this remarkable gift, and  how did they possess such prescient knowledge of our arrival?"

# Crashed colony ship
 eev_crashcol.1.name: "Crashed colony ship"
 eev_crashcol.1.desc: "The scientific expedition discovered the remains of an ancient colony ship of unknown origin dwarfing our own designs in size, this colossal vessel met its catastrophic end on a plateau several millennia ago, claiming the lives of all who were aboard. Regrettably, the onboard computers lay in complete ruin, rendering any attempt to ascertain its point of origin futile. Nonetheless, the hulking wreckage boasts a wealth of valuable alloys. In anticipation of a future recovery mission, our team placed a beacon to mark its location."

This phenomenon is generating extreme waves of radiations but §B[Root.GetFleetName]§!'s shields support their assault. §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! announced that this star will probably explode in a supernova before the next millennia. The crew has collected some exciting data that will have an important impact in physics research."

 unstable_gas.2.name: "Plasmoid gathering"
 unstable_gas.2.desc: "§G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! reports a remarkable discovery: the detection of a substantial herd of plasmoid beings within the gas giant's atmosphere. These extraordinary entities are voraciously consuming the planet's hydrogen, setting it ablaze with their staggering temperatures. At their current pace, it appears they will spend the next few centuries feasting upon §Y[From.GetName]§!'s resources before eventually departing in search of a new pasture."

 boom_asteroid.2.name: "Malfunction"
 boom_asteroid.2.desc: "As the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§!'s crew conducted a closer examination of the metallic structure, they unwittingly triggered an ear-splitting alarm that pierced the air. The countdown began at 30 seconds, alarming the crew as they spotted massive nuclear devices. Panic set in as they grappled with the realization that they were facing a dire situation. Thinking quickly, the crew attempted to disarm the devices, but they were inscribed with an incomprehensible alien script. Moments later, the countdown reached its conclusion... and nothing occurred. Gripped by the fear that it could activate at any instant, the crew hastily retreated to the safety of the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§!"
 boom_asteroid.1.a: "At least everyone is safe."

 eev_belltower_dig.2.desc: "After successfully stabilizing the sand, we meticulously excavated our way downward, gradually unveiling the intricate facade of the tower. In the dead of night, we finally arrived at a massive metallic door adorned with numerous engravings depicting a variety of alien races paying homage to a stylized sun. Currently, our challenge lies in deciphering the means to open these doors, as they remain impervious to our tools, much like the rest of the tower."
 eev_belltower_dig.3.name: "The belltower"
 eev_belltower_dig.3.desc: "As the first rays of dawn graced the desert, the sunlight bathed the door, causing the sun engraving to flash in response and initiating its opening. The crew proceeded with caution, stepping into the tower with a sense of uncertainty. What they encountered within was far from their expectations-a labyrinthine complex of machinery humming with pulsating energy, extending upward toward what appeared to be a colossal bell. Without hesitation, §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! issued orders for an immediate study of this enigmatic device."
 eev_belltower_dig.4.name: "Signal tower"
 eev_belltower_dig.4.desc: "Our scientists conducted a thorough examination of the building's interior but found no data or recordings. The machinery within resembles a communication tower, much like our own but on a colossal scale. It appears to be connected to the hyperlane system of our galaxy. However, the intriguing aspect is that it's currently dormant, not transmitting any signals. While the rest of the tower has been in operation for countless millennia, the emitter remains deactivated."
 eev_belltower_dig.5.name: "Ding"
 eev_belltower_dig.5.desc: "After a meticulous examination, §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! concluded that the only way to unravel the tower's purpose was to activate the emitter. With a decisive flip of the switch, [Root.Leader.GetSheHeCap] initiated the process. A beam of energy immediately hit the bell, releasing an harmonious §RDING§! that filled the building, coursed along the sand outside, and pulsed out of the transmitter towards the galaxy. The device then totally shut down, including the force field that had maintained its integrity. The tower immediately started to crumble, prompting our crew to make a hasty escape just in the nick of time."
 eev_belltower_dig.5.a: "What have we done?"
 eev_belltower.2.name: "Dong"
 eev_belltower.2.desc: "Shortly after the tower's activation, a remarkable phenomenon occurred across all our colonies, stations, and ships. Every communication device suddenly resonated with the bell's exquisite sound, captivating everyone for a few precious seconds as it touched the very depths of our souls. Then, as swiftly as it had appeared, it vanished forever. No recording device could capture a trace of it, leaving it to exist solely in the collective memory of our people."
